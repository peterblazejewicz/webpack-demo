## Note

This project derives from the original source code  that ships with a book. The code within this project is a mix of TypeScript and ES6 JavaScript. The TypeScript is used for type rich Webpack configuration, splitting in final Webpack configuration composition.

## Information

This version comes with some TypeScript support. The Webpack configuration is based on types and default support for `.ts` extension with the help of `ts-node`. 
See [Unambiguous Webpack config with Typescript](https://medium.com/webpack/unambiguous-webpack-config-with-typescript-8519def2cac7) to get some information on the concept. This project took a concept of using TypeScript in Webpack configuration, but modified it for code splitting and composing final configuration.
